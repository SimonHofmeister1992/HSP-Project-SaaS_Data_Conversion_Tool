https://pypi.org/project/exchangelib/1.9.6/

needed installation:
pip install exchangelib[kerberos]
or: pip install exchangelib[complete]

make sure the python version which installs this package is also used to execute the scripts,
due to the fact, that the exchangelib library is often installed to /home/$USER/.local/lib/<pythonversion>/site-packages/
if the wrong python version calls the script, the library will also not be found.

example: for me it makes a difference if i call python3 <scriptname> or python3.8 <scriptname> whereby the library is located in /home/$USER/.local/lib/python3.8/ which works and python3 references python3.6 which does not work.
